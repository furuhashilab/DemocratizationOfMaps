# DemocratizationOfMaps
「地図の民主化」というタイトルのテーマソングを作ってみた。


## Title: Democratization of Maps

### Verse 1:
Maps, a tool for navigation
But whose stories do they tell?
Colonizers' legacy, a biased creation
To hide what they don't want to sell

### Chorus:
Let's democratize the maps
Put the power in people's hands
No more top-down control
Let's draw a new plan

### Verse 2:
Indigenous names, forgotten places
Erased by the conquerors' might
Let's give them back their rightful spaces
And tell their stories right

### Chorus:
Let's democratize the maps
Put the power in people's hands
No more top-down control
Let's draw a new plan

### Bridge:
Maps shape our perception
Of the world we live in
Let's make them a reflection
Of the diversity we bring

### Chorus:
Let's democratize the maps
Put the power in people's hands
No more top-down control
Let's draw a new plan

### Outro:
Democratization of maps, a call to action
To rewrite history and make a just fraction.
